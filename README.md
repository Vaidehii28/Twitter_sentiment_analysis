A Machine Learning Project where we analyze tweets about coronavirus, with the goal of performing a Sentiment Analysis using BERT and roBERTa algorithms to predict the emotion of a tweet.
<br> <br>
<h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1> 
Twitter has become a crucial platform for individuals to share their opinions and emotions about various topics, including the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to extract valuable insights from Twitter data. In this study, we utilized BERT and roBERTa models to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of coronavirus-related tweets.<br><br>

<br><br>
<h1>METHODOLOGY:</h1>
We trained BERT and roBERTa models on the preprocessed dataset using a binary classification approach to predict whether a tweet had a positive or negative sentiment. We fine-tuned the models on the dataset for four epochs.

<h1>DATASET:</h1>
The dataset used in this study consisted of 48,000 tweets that were collected between March 2020 and May 2021. The tweets were preprocessed by removing stopwords, usernames, and hashtags. <br><br>

In conclusion, our study demonstrated the effectiveness of BERT and roBERTa models for sentiment analysis of coronavirus-related tweets. The roBERTa model outperformed the BERT model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results suggest that the use of state-of-the-art language models can significantly improve the accuracy and effectiveness of sentiment analysis on Twitter data. These findings can be used to inform public health policies and interventions related to the ongoing pandemic.
